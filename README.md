# Daemonizable Commands for Symfony2 [![Build Status of Master](https://travis-ci.org/mac-cain13/daemonizable-command.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mac-cain13/daemonizable-command)

**A small bundle to create endless running commands with Symfony2.**

These endless running commands are very easy to daemonize with something like Upstart or systemd.

## Why do I need this?
Because you want to create long running PHP/Symfony2 processes! For example to send mails with large attachment, process (delayed) payments or generate large PDF reports. They query the database or read from a message queue and do their job. This bundle makes it very easy to create such processes as Symfony2 commands.

## How to install?
Use composer to include it into your Symfony2 project:

`composer require wrep/daemonizable-command`

### What version to use?
Symfony did make some breaking changes, so you should make sure to use a compatible bundle version:
* Version 2.* for Symfony 3.0 and higher
* Version 1.2.* for Symfony 2.3
* Version 1.1.* for Symfony 2.2
* Version 1.0.* for Symfony 2.1 and lower

When upgrading, please consult the [changelog](Changelog.md) to see what could break your code.

## How to use?
Just create a Symfony2 command that extends from `EndlessCommand` and off you go. Here is a minimal example:

```php
namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Command;

use Wrep\Daemonizable\Command\EndlessCommand;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;

class MinimalDemoCommand extends EndlessCommand
{
	// This is just a normal Command::configure() method
	protected function configure()
	{
		$this->setName('acme:minimaldemo')
			 ->setDescription('An EndlessCommand implementation example');
	}

	// Execute will be called in a endless loop
	protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)
	{
		// Tell the user what we're going to do.
		// This will be a NullOutput if the user doesn't want any output at all,
		//  so you don't have to do any checks, just always write to the output.
		$output->write('Updating timestamp... ');

		// Do some work
		file_put_contents( '/tmp/acme-timestamp.txt', time() );

		// Tell the user we're done
		$output->writeln('done');
	}
}
```

Run it with `php app/console acme:minimaldemo`.

An [example with all the bells and whistles](examples/ExampleCommand.php) is also available and gives a good overview of best practices and how to do some basic things.

## How to daemonize?
Alright, now we have an endless running command *in the foreground*. Usefull for debugging, useless in production! So how do we make this thing a real daemon?

You should use [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com) (Ubuntu and others) or [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) (Fedora, ArchLinux and others) to daemonize the command. They provide very robust daemonization, start your daemon on a reboot and also monitor the process so it will try to restart it in the case of a crash.

An [example Upstart script](examples/example-daemon.conf) is available, place your script in `/etc/init/` and start the daemon with `start example-daemon`. The name of the `.conf`-file will be the name of the daemon. A systemd example is not yet available, but it shouldn't be that hard to [figure out](http://patrakov.blogspot.nl/2011/01/writing-systemd-service-files.html).

## Command line switches
A few switches are available by default to make life somewhat easier:

* Use `-q` to suppress all output
* Use `--run-once` to only run the command once, usefull for debugging
* Use `--detect-leaks` to print a memory usage report after each run, read more in the next section

## Memory usage and leaks
Memory usage is very important for long running processes. Symfony2 is not the smallest framework around and if you leak some memory in your execute method your daemon will crash! The `EndlessCommand` classes have been checked for memory leaks, but you should also check your own code.

### How to prevent leaks?
Always start your command with the `-e prod --no-debug` flags. This disables all debugging features of Symfony2 that will eat up more and more memory.

Do not use Monolog in Symfony 2.2 and lower, there is a [bug in the MonologBundle](https://github.com/symfony/MonologBundle/issues/37) that starts the debughandler even though you disable the profiler. This eats up your memory. Note that this is [fixed](https://github.com/symfony/MonologBundle/commit/1fc0864a9344b15a04ed90612a91cf8e5b8fb305) in Symfony 2.3 and up.

Make sure you cleanup in the `execute`-method, make sure you're not appending data to an array every iteration or leave sockets/file handles open for example.

### Detecting memory leaks
Run your command with the `--detect-leaks` flag. Remember that debug mode will eat memory so you'll need to run with `-e prod --no-debug --detect-leaks` for accurate reports.

After each iteration a memory report like this is printed on your console:
```
== MEMORY USAGE ==
Peak: 30038.86 KByte stable (0.000 %)
Cur.: 29856.46 KByte stable (0.000 %)
```

The first 3 iterations may be unstable in terms of memory usage, but after that it should be stable. *Even a slight increase of memory usage will crash your daemon over time!*

If you see an increase/stable/decrease loop you're probably save. It could be the garabage collector not cleaning up, you can fix this by using unset on variables to cleanup the memory yourself.

### Busting some myths
Calling `gc_collect_cycles()` will not help to resolve leaks. PHP will cleanup memory right in time all by itself, calling this method may slow down leaking memory, but will not solve it. Also it makes spotting leaks harder, so just don't use it.

If you run Symfony2 in production and non-debug mode it will not leak memory and you do not have to disable any SQL loggers. The only leak I runned into is the one in the MonologBundle mentioned above.
